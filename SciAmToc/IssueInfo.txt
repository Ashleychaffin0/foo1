43 STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND DIRECTED-ENERGY WEAPONS, by C. Kumar N. Patel and Nicolaas Bloembergen
	SDI partisans attack and SDI critics invoke the findings of the American Physical Society panel that evaluated the feasibility of lasers and particle-beam weapons as instruments of strategic defense. Here, for the public record, is a summary of what the panel—which consisted of weapons experts and knowledgeable physicists—actually said.
50 THE LARGE-SCALE STREAMING OF GALAXIES, by Alan Dressler
	Even as they are swept apart by the expanding fabric of space, the Milky Way and a host of other galaxies show motion of their own; the speed and direction of the motion indicate that the galaxies are caught in the sway of a Great Attractor, a distant concentration of mass that appears to be larger than any proposed by existing cosmologies.
60 REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION, by Harold Varmus
	When first discovered, the ability to transcribe DNA from RNA was thought to be unique to a few cancer-causing viruses. Now it seems the Process may be part of the genetic machinery of other viruses and even of higher organisms; studies of it could further understanding of AIDS and oncogenes and may illuminate the evolution of hereditary material itself.
70 ELECTRIDES, by James L. Dye
	In this new class of crystalline materials, derived from cesium, potassium and other alkali metals, a lattice of positively charged atoms caged in neutral molecules is held together by trapped clouds of free-floating electrons. Various kinds of electrides can be made, whose electronic and optical properties range from those of nonmetals to those of metals.
80 MIMICRY IN PLANTS, by Spencer C. H. Barrett
	Life can be a competitive struggle even for plants. In cultivated environments some weeds imitate crops and thereby avoid being destroyed. In natural habitats orchids that mimic female insects attract male insects, which proceed to carry pollen from flower to flower. Some plants have even come to resemble stones and thus deter predators.
90 THE SWAHILI CORRIDOR, by Mark Horton
	As 10th-century Europe awoke from the Dark Ages an energetic revival of the arts generated a demand for such exotic materials as transparent quartz, ivory and gold. To meet the demand Swahili traders plied the waters of the East African coast, sailing 3,000 kilometers to forge a trade route that reached all the way to the Mediterranean.
100 HOW CHILDREN LEARN WORDS, by George A. Miller and Patricia M Gildea
	To attain the vocabulary of a high school graduate, some 80,000 words, a child needs to learn new words at the rate of about 5,000 a year. The way to aid the process is to exploit the ability of a child to learn by seeing words in context. An interactive video display presenting definitions, sample sentences and pictures may be the best teaching device.
106 COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS FOR THE FUTURE, by Richard E. Balzhiser and Kurt E. Yeager By the end of the century some 70 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S. may come from coal-fired power plants. To improve their efficiency and to reduce environmental impact new kinds of plants are called for, based on fluidized-bed combustion and coal gasification; such plants may also be able to yield sulfur in economically useful forms.

60 THE NEXT COMPUTER REVOLUTION, by Abraham Peled
	In the first computer revolution the technology emerged from the laboratory as an indispensable amplifier of human intellect. A new revolution is under way: the power of computers will increase by an order of magnitude while they become as accessible and convenient as the telephone.
70 ADVANCED COMPUTER ARCHITECTURES, by Geoffrey C Fox and Paul C Messina
	Supercomputers can perform millions of operations per second. To perform billions of operations per second, a new computer architecture called parallel processing must be realized; such machines solve the elements of a problem simultaneously rather than in sequence.
82 CHIPS FOR ADVANCED COMPUTING, by James D. Meindl
	The chip is the building block of computer architectures. The goal is speed, the strategy miniaturization. As elements grow smaller their density increases geometrically and operating speed goes up arithmetically; by the year 2000 there may be a billion elements on a single chip.
94 PROGRAMMING FOR ADVANCED COMPUTING, by David Gelernter
	Parallel computers need parallel programs. Some linear programs can be"parallelized" automatically. In another approach, independent processes exchange messages as tasks are completed; in a third, elements called tuples ply tuple space, processing and becoming information.
122 DATA-STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ADVANCED COMPUTING, by Mark H. Kryder
	Advanced computers generate vast amounts of data, and yet storage devices can keep up. Magnetic devices should attain densities of four million characters per square centimeter in five years; by then magneto-optical devices may hold 10 million characters per square centimeter.
134 INTERFACES FOR ADVANCED COMPUTING, by James D. Foley
	Beyond the mouse and touch screen are new ways to make a computer natural to use. They include voice communication, an electronic pad that responds to handwriting, sensors that track eye movement and a glove that enables the wearer to manipulate objects on the screen.
144 NETWORKS FOR ADVANCED COMPUTING, by Robert E. Kahn
	The information generated by computing is useless until it is communicated, and so the nature of the networks that link computers is as important as raw computing power. Establishing an effective network can be as difficult a task as getting the machines to think.
152 ADVANCED COMPUTING FOR SCIENCE, by Piet Hut and Gerald Jay Sussman
	Computing has begun to change how science is done. Computing can reckon the results of unforeseen combinations of factors or the influence of small effects. Galaxies can be hurled together and the results compared to the actual behavior of matter far out in the universe.
164 ADVANCED COMPUTING FOR MEDICINE, by Glenn D. Rennels and Edward H. Shortliffe
	A patient visits her doctor because of low-back pain. Could the symptom point to a recurrence of serious illness? Computing might support the extraordinary intuitive process by which a physician answers that question. Such expert systems may become as indispensable as the stethoscope.
172 ADVANCED COMPUTING FOR MANUFACTURING, by Albert M Erisman and Kenneth W. Neves
	Designing a product such as an airframe can require thousands of hours and millions of dollars' worth of model building, testing and prototype	refinement. Supercomputers can cut the time and cost sharply, and they can model such physical processes as airflow in entirely new ways.

50 DIET AND CANCER, by Leonard A. Cohen
	Equipped with Stone Age physiology, U.S. citizens confront a modern diet. There is evidence but not proof that the result is a high risk for certain cancers. Now the	National Research Council has recommended a diet with less fat and refined sugar and more fiber. Is the council right? Can an individual afford to wait for more definitive word? 
58 HELIUM-RICH SUPERNOVAS, by J. Craig Wheeler and Robert P. Harkness
	For half a century astronomers and astrophysicists have thought that there were two kinds of supernova: Type I, a thermonuclear explosion of a white-dwarf star, and Type II, a cataclysmic collapse of a red supergiant star. Discovery of a new supernova class and supernova 1987A shows that many events combine the features of Type I and Type II.
70 ARTIFICIAL CHROMOSOMES, by Andrew W. Murray and Jack W. Szostak
	The existence of life depends on the accurate transmission of genetic information. Artificial chromosomes made from the DNA of yeast cells, protozoa and bacterial viruses may illuminate how such transmission is accomplished. The chromosomes may also yield clues to the causes of Down syndrome and provide new tools for genetic engineering.
96 SYNCHROTRON RADIATION, by Herman Winick
	Once regarded as an unwanted consequence of accelerating electrons or positrons to relativistic speeds in a synchrotron or storage ring, this radiation turns out to be valuable for research, medicine and integrated-circuit manufacture. Growing demand has led to a boomlet in storage-ring construction and progress in the underlying technology.
110 THE ANCESTRY OF THE GIANT PANDA, by Stephen J. O'Brien
	Is the giant panda a descendant of the same progenitor as the contemporary bear? Is it more closely related to the raccoon? Or should the panda be assigned to a unique family of its own? Electrophoresis, DNA hybridization, chromosomal analysis and other techniques of molecular biology have defined the panda's ancestry.
116 DEMONS, ENGINES AND THE SECOND LAW, by Charles H. Bennett
	According to the second law of thermodynamics, it is impossible to design a perpetual-motion machine that runs on the random motions of molecules. Yet in 1871 James Clerk Maxwell invented a molecule-sorting demon who for a century has seemed to live beyond the reach of the law. It now appears that Maxwell's demon has been exorcised.
126 EARLY FARMING IN NORTHWESTERN EUROPE, by John M Howell
	The archaeologist's distribution maps of Neolithic sites, formerly regarded as a mere clerical convenience, turn out themselves to be evidence. They have sharply changed the perception of how agriculture spread through northern Europe, and they reveal profound social changes that took place in the middle and late Neolithic periods.
136 MODELING TIDAL POWER, by David A. Greenberg
	The famous tidal surges in the Bay of Fundy that sometimes send tourists running for their lives have long held the potential of economic power generation. Computer modeling of the bay and the Gulf of Maine enables planners and environmentalists to gauge what the impact of a tidal power installation might be as far away as Boston Harbor.

50 TECHNOLOGY IN SERVICES, by James Brian Quinn, Jordan J. Baruch and Penny Cushman Paquette
	With the services sector now accounting for most of the U.S. economy, doubts that it can function as an engine of overall growth have intensified. Actually many service industries utilize advanced technology to improve productivity. They contribute to competitiveness in manufacturing and even promote a favorable balance of payments.
60 THE MOON'S ANCIENT MAGNETISM, by S. K Runcorn
	Lunar fossil magnetism suggests that the moon had an eventful past. The strength and direction of the magnetism imply that it is the relic of a field generated by a liquid iron core within the ancient moon. The magnetic poles appear to have shifted with respect to the surface, perhaps because collisions with orbiting satellites reoriented the moon about its spin axis.
72 HOW ANIMAL CELLS MOVE, by Mark S. Bretscher
	A white cell must be able to maneuver to the site of an infection, fibroblasts migrate into a wound to repair damage and wandering cancer cells make tumors metastasize. An animal cell moves by taking in bits of its surface membrane and returning them preferentially at its leading edge. The process somewhat resembles the action of a tank tread.
94 COSMIC STRINGS, by Alexander Vilenkin
	Remnants of the infant universe, cosmic strings are massive, wiggling threads created in the second following the big bang. Their powerful gravitational effects may have caused the clustering of stars and galaxies that is evident in space—but before any firm cosmological conclusions can be drawn, theorists will have to prove that the strings exist.
104 COLLECTIVE COMPUTATION IN NEURONLIKE CIRCUITS, by David W. Tank and John J. Hopfield
	Computers excel at rote tasks such as crunching numbers, but they cannot recognize a face or carry out many other operations that people and animals do rapidly and automatically. Electronic circuits based on biological nervous systems can perform significant computations and are inspiring new designs for chips and computers.
116 COURTSHIP IN UNISEXUAL LIZARDS: A MODEL FOR BRAIN EVOLUTION, by David Crews
	In several species of whiptail lizards there are no males; reproduction is parthenogenetic. Some females nonetheless assume the role of males, engaging in courtship and pseudocopulation. It appears that in these species the brain can give rise to both male and female behavior regardless of an individual's biological sex.
122 THE FRACTURING OF GLASS, by Terry A Michalske and Bruce C Bunker
	Flaw-free glass can withstand tensile loads of two million pounds per square inch or more-10 times as much stress as many metal alloys can tolerate. By exploring on an atomic scale just what goes on at the tip of a crack, investigators are making progress toward exploiting the extraordinary strength of glass in a widening variety of applications.
130 H.M.S. WARRIOR, by Walter Brownlee
	It was the first iron-hulled warship and it profoundly changed naval warfare and perhaps warfare itself. Warrior gave the Royal Navy a novel strategic ploy: deterrence. Powered by both steam and sail, the invulnerable vessel could catch and destroy any ship—or fleet—on the seas. As France and Germany countered, a modern arms race ensued.

30 THE ANTARCTIC OZONE HOLE, by Richard S. Stolarski
	A thin layer of ozone in the stratosphere protects human beings and other life forms by absorbing most of the ultraviolet radiation of the sun. The discovery of a springtime ozone "hole" over the South Pole suggests that the entire ozone layer may be thinning. What causes the hole—a global rise in pollutants or a natural change in Antarctic air movements?
38 HOW KILLER CELLS KILL, by John Ding-E Young and Zanvil A. Cohn
	Killer lymphocytes, the commandos of the immune system, attack tumor cells and cells infected by viruses. They kill by secreting protein molecules that link to form pores in target cells; the cells promptly leak to death. Study of the process may make it possible to improve the killers' efficiency in fighting cancer and such viral infections as AIDS.
46 THE REALITY OF THE QUANTUM WORLD, by Abner Shimony
	Is a photon a particle or a wave? That depends, the quantum mechanic says, on how—and when—you look at it. Common sense and aesthetics say it must be one or the other; the paradox bothers nonphysicists, and indeed it bothered Einstein. Yet the quantum mechanic is right. Elegant benchtop experiments show that the bizarre quantum world is real.
54 THE VERY-LONG-BASELINE ARRAY, by Kenneth I. Kellermann and A. Richard Thompson
	The resolution of a radio telescope depends on the diameter of its antenna. The VLBA, an array of 10 antennas stretching from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii, will have an effective "diameter" of some 8,000 kilometers. With it astronomers will study such deep questions as whether black holes are the source of the prodigious energy of quasars.
64 INTERTIDAL FISHES, by Michael H. Horn and Robin N. Gibson
	How can fish live in the harsh intertidal zone, where they are buffeted by waves and currents when the tide is in and are often left high and dry at low tide? Remarkable adaptations—including tolerance of dehydration, fins modified for crawling and clinging and even the ability to breathe	air—make survival possible where the oceans and seas meet the land.
72 THE NOT-SO-RARE EARTHS, by Gunter K. Muecke and Peter Moller
	They are neither rare nor earths. They are metallic elements present in small concentrations in most minerals. Their relative abundance gives geologists clues to the geochemistry of magmas and hydrothermal solutions. The rare earths are essential constituents of advanced alloys, laser crystals and the new high-temperature superconductors.
78 ART, ILLUSION AND THE VISUAL SYSTEM, by Margaret S. Livingstone
	The verve of op art, the serenity of a pointillist painting and the 3-D puzzlement of an Escher print derive from the interplay of the art with the anatomy of the visual system. Color, shape and movement are each processed separately by different structures in the eye and brain and then are combined to produce the experience we call perception.
86 THE TRANSFORMER, by John W. Coltman
	Invented in the mid-19th century, it is still essential: it makes electricity a convenient form of energy by converting a generator's low-voltage, high-current output into high-voltage, low-current power for efficient transmission—and then back again for consumption. Without it homes, office buildings and factories would need their own generators.

48 4 CHROMOSOME MAPPING WITH DNA MARKERS, by Ray White and Jean-Marc Lalouel
	New markers called RFLP'S (for restriction-fragment length polymorphisms) can indicate the location on a chromosome of a disease-causing gene and serve to identify carriers. With enough markers one can map the human chromosomes—the first step toward an ambitious goal of molecular biology: sequencing the entire human genome.
58 A FLAW IN A UNIVERSAL MIRROR, by Robert K. Adair
	If matter and antimatter existed in equal quantities, they would have annihilated each other; there would be no universe, and no one to contemplate its majesty. The cosmos exists because a subtle flaw in symmetry gave matter the edge just after the big bang. What force is responsible for the flaw? Clues may come from particle physics.
90 GABAERGIC NEURONS, by David I. Gottlieb
	One tends to think of the nervous system in terms of chains of excitatory signals that tell neurons to fire. The signals that say "Don't fire" also have a major role. Inhibitory signals damp overall neural activity and also fine-tune the responses of particular circuits. The primary carrier of these signals is the inhibitory transmitter known as GABA.
98 HOW CLIMATE EVOLVED ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS, by James F. Kasting, Owen B. Toon and James B. Pollack
	It is called the Goldilocks problem: Why is Mars too cold for life, Venus too hot and the earth just right? Distance from the sun is not the full answer. The earth cycles carbon dioxide into its atmosphere to promote greenhouse warming when its surface cools. Mars lacks that ability. Venus has the opposite problem: it cannot drain CO2 from its atmosphere.
106 THE ADAPTABLE OPOSSUM, by Steven N. Austad
	Familiarity has bred contempt for this marsupial. The opossum does lack beauty and dignity, but it is a repository of other virtues. It adapts to a wide range of environments and negotiates mazes better than dogs, cats or pigs do, and it stands up to rattlesnakes. It also adjusts the sex ratio of its offspring, bearing more males than females when times are good.
112 PLASTICS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY, by Richard B. Kaner and Alan G. MacDiarmid
	The title is no longer oxymoronic, as it was 20 years ago. A graduate student's mistake led one of the authors to "dope" polyacetylene with iodine, thereby increasing the plastic's conductivity a billion times. Today a lightweight battery made of a conducting polymer is on the market, and a host of other applications can be foreseen.
124 RAMANUJAN AND PI, by Jonathan M. Borwein and Peter B. Borwein
	Last year pi (3.14...) was calculated to 100 million places. A century earlier a son was born to two impoverished Brahmins. The connection? Before Srinivasa Ramanujan died at 32 he created an astounding body of mathematical theory. The algorithm that extended pi to unprecedented accuracy embodied infinite series that were devised by Ramanujan.
132 THE BUBONIC PLAGUE, by Colin McEvedy
	In A.D. 1346 some 100 million people inhabited Europe, northern Africa and the Near East. Five years later 25 million were dead—victims of the Black Death. The plague kept reappearing, but the epidemics did not spread as widely: apparently a new and milder strain of Yersinia pestis evolved that made at least some people immune to the virulent strain.

41 THE NONACOUSTIC DETECTION OF SUBMARINES, by Tom Ste fanick
	The best insurance against nuclear attack is the nuclear submarine armed with ballistic missiles. Virtually undetectable, such a vessel can ride out a first strike and unleash devastation on the attacker. Are there advances in physics or new technologies that can render the oceans transparent and the deterrent vulnerable?
48 GRAVITY AND ANTIMATTER, by Terry Goldman, Richard J. Hughes and Michael Martin Nieto
	Would an antiapple fall to the ground at the same rate as an apple? General relativity and quantum mechanics suggest a positive answer, but there is a crack in the voice of apparent affirmation: the two theories have never been reconciled. Indeed, attempts to do so suggest that in the sway of gravity, matter and antimatter are not the same.
58 CATALYTIC ANTIBODIES, by Richard A. Lerner and Alfonso Tramontano
	Like the proverbial matchmaker, enzymes help reactions to happen faster by bringing the reactants together under favorable circumstances. Unfortunately nature has supplied only a limited repertoire of these molecules. Now there is genuine promise that their number can be extended by antibodies designed to act as catalysts.
72 CONSTRUCTION CRANES, by Lawrence K. Shapiro and Howard I. Shapiro
	They are essential tools of the building trade and can be found in a wide variety of forms wherever high-rise structures climb toward the sky. Selecting the right crane for the job is critical for reasons both of economy and of safety, and at a crowded urban site the choice can sometimes present a formidable engineering challenge.
80 HOW THE LEOPARD GETS ITS SPOTS, by James D. Murray
	An interplay between the number and variety of pigment cells in an embryo and the size of the embryo is a factor; additional factors are mathematical rules like those that govern the vibration of a violin string or the surface of a steel drum. Such resonances, interacting with size and shape, determine whether spots, stripes or other patterns form.
88 FATNESS AND FERTILITY, by Rose E. Frisch
	If its figurines are an indication, Paleolithic society favored fullness of figure in women, as did Rubens and Renoir. There is biological sense in such a standard of beauty. A woman must store a threshold, or minimum, amount of body fat in order to be able to reproduce; gaining or losing just a few pounds can make all the difference.
96 THE QUANTUM-EFFECT DEVICE: TOMORROW'S TRANSISTOR?, by Robert T. Bate
	There are limits on the size and number of circuit elements that can be packed on a computer chip. One is the wave behavior of electrons, which can interfere with performance in the smallest of devices. Physicists are now turning that behavior to their advantage in a new kind of component that depends on electron waves for its operation.
102 THE ROMAN PORT OF COSA, by Anna Marguerite McCann
	Two decades of interdisciplinary archaeology have produced a portrait of the economy, society and technology of a Mediterranean Roman port. Concrete piers, fish farming and processing, amphora manufacture and a freshwater-distribution system supported a bustling population dominated by a single entrepreneurial family, the Sestii.

	If there is more in a composer's head than strings, woodwinds and brasses can utter, he or she can turn to the computer. It synthesizes sounds the composer's mind hears, and its electronic output can be interwoven with the sounds of conventional instruments. A composer-conductor and his colleague report from the techno-artistic frontier.
58 THE SELF, THE WORLD AND AUTOIMMUNITY, by Irun R. Cohen
	When the immune system fails to distinguish between self and not self, it may attack the self, giving rise to autoimmune disease. Now it appears that the self-recognizing and self-attacking properties of the immune system can be exploited to police its own aberrant behavior by destroying the rogue cells responsible for certain autoimmune diseases.
75 THE MEMBRANE PARADIGM FOR BLACK HOLES, by Richard H. Price and Kip S. Thorne
	Black holes, those holes in space that trap light, curve space and slow time, are well understood in terms of general relativity. How, though, is one to study them as real astrophysical objects—which may, for example, supply power for quasars? The authors suggest thinking of a black hole as a spheroidal surface made of a thin, electrically conducting membrane.
84 ENERGY-EFFICIENT BUILDINGS, by Arthur H. Rosenfeld and David Hafemeister
	Since the 1973 oil famine the U.S. has learned to save $45 billion a year by making homes and offices more energy-efficient. Now an oil glut has led to complacency. This is shortsighted. For 50 to 100 years the nation will be paying energy bills for buildings going up today. Innovative technologies and policies can cut $50 billion a year from those bills.
102 LIGHT SWITCHES FOR PLANT GENES, by Phyllis B. Moses and Nam-Hai Chua
	Light, for plants, is more than energy for photosynthesis. It tells a plant when to sprout, how to grow, when to flower and when to age. To do those things light must affect plant genes. Stretches of DNA that turn genes on and off in response to light have been identified. Such knowledge may help molecular biologists to engineer better crops.
108 THE EFFECTS OF SPIN IN GASES, by Franck Lalog and Jack H. Freed
	Quantum mechanics describes the activity of individual atoms; who would have thought the theory could predict the behavior of a gas of billions of randomly moving atoms? It turns out that modifying the spin angular momentum of certain atomic nuclei can change macroscopic properties of gases, such as the speed at which they conduct heat.
116 THE BEHAVIOR OF BALEEN WHALES, by Bernd Wursig
	It is not easy to study whales: they are big and they spend most of their time underwater. Yet careful observations reveal that baleen whales (the ones that have frondlike sieves in place of teeth) communicate, feed, mate and play much like the ungulates (terrestrial grazers) from which they evolved some 55 million years ago.
124 TREMBLEY'S POLYPS, by Howard M. Lenhoff and Sylvia G. Lenhoff
	The hydra, a tiny polyp that seems all stem and arms, has a central role in the history of biological science. In 1740 Abraham Trembley, a young tutor, undertook studies of the hydra that demonstrated grafting, regeneration and asexual reproduction by budding in animals—and that taught naturalists the value of precise observation and experimentation.

42 CONTROLLING INDOOR AIR POLLUTION, by Anthony V. Nero, Jr.
	You can't go home to escape air pollution; it lurks indoors. One hazard is the radon gas that seeps into some houses from underlying rock and soil. And then there are cigarette smoke, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde.... How harmful is such pollution, how can exposure to it be reduced and what should which Federal, state or local agencies be doing about it?
50 SQUEEZED LIGHT, by Richart E. Slusher and Bernard Yurke
	Even in darkness there is light: quantum fluctuations called noise animate the darkness and blur the definition of light waves, limiting the precision of crucial experimental measurements. The uncertainty around a light wave can be squeezed, making some parts of the wave quieter and thus more precise (at the expense of making other parts noisier).
59 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR, by Lloyd J. Old
	A century ago it was noted that a bacterial infection sometimes causes the regression of cancer. In 1975 the author found an explanation: the infection stimulates the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which has anticancer activity. Now TNF, an important regulator of inflammation and immunity, is in clinical trials as an anticancer drug.
76 ANCIENT MAGNETIC REVERSALS: CLUES TO THE GEODYNAMO, by Kenneth A. Hoffman
	The earth's magnetic field reverses itself repeatedly; such a reversal may be under way now. The history of reversals can be puzzled out by studying remanent magnetism in rocks. Analysis of ancient reversals is yielding clues to the nature of the dynamo—the churning of molten metals in the earth's outer core—that generates the magnetic field.
84 THE PLATYPUS, by Mervyn Griffiths
	A bizarre array of characteristics contributes to this Australian mammal's evolutionary success. It dives like a seal, lays eggs like a reptile, has a tail like a beaver's and a bill like a duck's. The bill is a food-finding antenna: it bears receptors for the weak electric fields that are generated by the aquatic invertebrates on which the platypus feeds.
92 AEROGELS, by Jochen Fricke
	Gels are mostly liquid. Replace the liquid with air or another gas and you have an aerogel, a material whose properties challenge the physicist and tantalize the product engineer. Aerogels are tricky to make, but they turn out to be very useful. For example, aerogels made from silicon dioxide are transparent in addition to being excellent thermal insulators.
98 THE INDIAN NECK OSSUARY, by Francis P. McManamon and James W. Bradley
	In 1979 a backhoe operator working near Wellfleet, Mass., unearthed human bones. He had come on a 1,000-year-old ossuary (a bone repository) that has provided new information about the prehistory of the northeastern U.S. Along with other evidence, it suggests there were permanent Native American settlements along the New England coast.
106 THE MYSTERY OF THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT, by Larry Abbott
	The constant, a measure of the energy of the vacuum, is "cosmological" because its value has implications for the structure and fate of the universe. The wide divergence between theoretical and observed values of the constant could mean that modern physics is on the verge of a profound new understanding of the nature of space, time and matter.

52 U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH, by Ralph Landau
	The once brisk rate of growth has slowed, U.S. industry barely competes in the world marketplace and the Federal deficit is measured in cosmological numbers. What is to be done? The author argues that aggressive exploitation of technology, fueled by more intense capital investment in the manufacturing sector, is the answer.
64 "SNURPS", by Joan Argetsinger Steitz
	The whimsical acronym refers to "small nuclear ribonucleoproteins," which play a key role in the process whereby genetic information directs the activities of a living cell. SnRNP's help to delete the meaningless stretches called introns from messenger RNA. The author was one of the first investigators to reveal their function.
74 PARTICLE ACCELERATORS TEST COSMOLOGICAL THEORY, by David N. Schramm and Gary Steigman
	Students of the nature of matter and those who contemplate the structure of the universe are talking to each other. Particle physicists are testing cosmological theories that for the first time make assertions about the nature of matter—predicting, for example, that there must be a limit to the number of elementary particles.
82 PEROVSKITES, by Robert M Hazen
	They are crystalline ceramics and the earth's most abundant minerals. The electrical properties of perovskites run the full gamut: most of them are insulators, but some are semiconductors or conductors. And now it turns out that the exciting new high-temperature superconductors are all flawed, manmade members of the same basic crystallographic group.
90 BACTERIA AS MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, by James A Shapiro
	A bacterium seldom lives alone, except under the bacteriologist's carefully focused microscope. In nature bacteria live communally. In the laboratory they are seen to form complex multicellular communities whose shapes and patterns of movement seem to be programmed. In some species individual cells even differentiate to accomplish specific tasks.
98 POLYNYAS IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN, by Arnold L Gordon and Jose fino C. Comiso
	These great holes in the Antarctic sea ice, as much as 350,000 square kilometers in area, are the sites of large-scale exchanges of energy and gases between the ocean and the atmosphere. By venting heat rapidly, polynyas accelerate the global heat engine that drives motions of the seas and the atmosphere, helping to shape the world's climate.
106 THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF FEEDING IN LEECHES, by Charles M Lent and Michael H. Dickinson
	How does a simple nervous system control a behavior? In the bloodsucking medicinal leech a single neurotransmitter, serotonin, has been found to orchestrate the animal's search for a target, the movements of its jaws, the filling of its crop and even the distension of its body that eventually tells the leech enough is enough.
112 EARLY IRON SMELTING IN CENTRAL AFRICA, by Francis Van Noten and Jan Raymaekers
	Until early in this century the people living near Lake Victoria smelted iron in tall charcoal-burning furnaces at temperatures that reached 1,400 degrees Celsius. The workings of this age-old technology have been delineated by archaeology and by "ethnoreconstruction" carried out with the help of old inhabitants who remembered how it was done.

46 THE GEOGRAPHY OF U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, by J. Clark Archer, Fred M Shelley, Peter J. Taylor and Ellen R White
	Urban-suburban-rural differences, yuppie hopes and pensioners' fears, ban-the-bombers and right-to-lifers—all may have less impact in November than the insistent and persistent sectionalism that underlies U.S. voting behavior. One example: the Republicans' continuing hold on the West means the Democrats need to win both the Northeast and the South.
56 GRAVITATIONAL LENSES, by Edwin L Turner
	Astronomers are searching intensively for these cosmic flukes. In a lens system the gravitational field of a galaxy bends light from a far-distant quasar so that the quasar's image is distorted. The nature of the distortion reveals much about the distant source, the lensing object and the space	in between, and it may answer some deep cosmological questions.
64 HORMONES THAT STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF BLOOD CELLS, by David W. Golde and Judith C. Gasson
	The red blood cells and the white cells of the immune system are all descendants of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Specific hormones cause the various cell types to differentiate and mature. The genes for several of the hormones have been cloned; soon it should be possible to treat diseases by calling up an extra supply of needed cells.
82 THE SUPERCONTINENT CYCLE, by R Damian Nance, Thomas R Worsley and Judith B. Moody
	Pangaea, the authors think, was only the most recent in a series of supercontinents that have been breaking up and reassembling every 500 million years or so. The cycle, driven by heat percolating up from the mantle, splits continents and drives interrelated processes that shape the earth's geology and climate and play a role in biological evolution.
90 RANDOMNESS IN ARITHMETIC, by Gregory J. Chaitin
	Physics has its uncertainty principle, but surely mathematics, unfettered by physical reality, can arrive at certainty? No; 2 plus 2 may equal 4, but not all of mathematics is subject to logical absolutism. An example tying computer science to number theory suggests that mathematicians too must sometimes be satisfied with probabilistic statements.
96 CAPACITORS, by Donald M. Trotter, Jr.
	These humble devices are essential electronic guardians of integrated circuits, diverting stray signals and protecting chips from excess charge. The principles underlying their design are still those of the 18th-century Leyden jar, but the size has been reduced: in one type the surface area of a newspaper page is packaged in a device smaller than a sugar cube.
104 HOW THE HUMAN EYE FOCUSES, by Jane F. Koretz and George H. Handelman
	A 10-year-old boy can focus on the tip of his own nose, but most people need reading glasses by the age of 45 or so. Why does the lens of the eye gradually lose the ability to focus on nearby objects? With the help of mathematical models, the authors learn how geometrical and biochemical changes conspire together to impair close focusing.
112 THE CHACO CANYON COMMUNITY, by Stephen H. Lekson, Thomas C Windes, John R. Stein and W. James Judge
	In the desolate San Juan Basin, near the point where New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado meet, stand the ruins of nine multistory structures built more than 1,000 years ago by the Anasazi tribe; from them the traces of ancient roads radiate across the Southwest. What went on in the Chaco Canyon Great Houses, and where did their elaborate road system lead?

30 THE CHALLENGE OF ACID RAIN, by Volker A Mohnen
	The main culprits are sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen; the main sources are power plants and automobiles. The effects of acid rain on waters are now beyond debate, and it is thought to harm vegetation. There is no doubt the destructive emissions must be lessened. Economically viable technologies include coal gasification and fluidized-bed combustion. 
40 THE HIGH FIDELITY OF DNA DUPLICATION, by Miroslav Radman and Robert Wagner
	It takes some three billion nucleotide letters to spell "human being"  genetically; if even one in every million letters were wrong, the results  would be disastrous. Actually far fewer molecular typos occur. When a  strand of DNA is copied, three enzyme systems work together to pick a  matching nucleotide, proofread the new DNA and correct any mismatches.
48 MEASURING CRUSTAL DEFORMATION IN THE AMERICAN WEST, by Thomas H. Jordan and J. Bernard Minster
	The crust of the western U.S. is deforming: blocks slide past each other  along the San Andreas Fault, the Great Basin is spreading apart and  mountains are being thrust up along the California coast. Measurements  relying on radio waves from quasars or satellites relate this deformation to  large-scale motions of the Pacific and North America plates.
60 BEYOND TRUTH AND BEAUTY: A FOURTH FAMILY OF PARTICLES, by David B. Cline
	How many fundamental particles are there? The number seemed  appropriately small (proton, neutron, electron) until accelerators spewed  out hundreds of new subnuclear particles. The quark restored order—until  quarks themselves proliferated. Now simplicity may triumph again. There  may be four—but no more than five—quark-lepton families.
68 LIGHT-ACTIVATED DRUGS, by Richard L Edelson
	A drug known to the ancient Egyptians is combined with simple technology  to treat a severe leukemia. Cancerous T cells in blood removed from the  patient's body are damaged by exposure to the drug, which is activated by  ultraviolet radiation. When the cells are returned to the body, they trigger  an immunological attack on the remaining cancerous T cells.
76 PERCEIVING SHAPE FROM SHADING, by Vilayanur S. Ramachandran
	If you turn most photographs of the moon upside down, the shadows tell  the wrong story: craters become mountains. The reason is that the most  primitive form of depth perception—that based on shading—depends on  where you think the light is coming from. Shading also interacts with other  aspects of visual processing to produce startling optical illusions.
84 X-RAY IMAGING WITH CODED MASKS, by Gerald K Skinner
	Supernovas, black holes and ultrahot plasmas give off high-energy X rays.  How can images be formed from such rays, which cannot be focused? The  trick is to have the X rays illuminate an artfully arranged set of holes in an  opaque mask. A computer can reconstruct the shape of the X-ray source  from the form of the X-ray "shadow" cast by the mask.
90 DR. ATANASOFF'S COMPUTER, by Allan R. Mackintosh
	It was nothing less than the first electronic digital computer. In 1937 John  V. Atanasoff developed fundamental concepts of the modern computer:  electronic switches, logical manipulation of binary numbers and  "regeneration" of memory to keep data from disappearing. By 1942 he had  a computer that worked, but World War II prevented further development.

36 CIVILIAN CASUALTIES FROM COUNTERFORCE ATTACKS, by Frank N. von Hippel, Barbara G. Levi, Theodore A. Postol and William H. Daugherty 
	From the standpoint of civilian casualties, the distinction between a  nuclear attack on strategic targets and one on cities is largely academic.  Computer simulations show that counterforce attacks by either side  against the other side's missile sites, command-and-control centers and  other strategic targets would produce very high civilian casualties.
44 FINDING THE ANTI-ONCOGENE, by Robert A. Weinberg
	Whereas oncogenes initiate cancer by actively promoting excessive cell  growth, an anti-oncogene normally constrains growth; lacking it, a cell may  proliferate out of control. The author and his colleagues have isolated the  first anti-oncogene, whose inheritance in a mutated, inactive form confers  an inborn susceptibility to retinoblastoma, an eye tumor.
54 DETECTING INDIVIDUAL ATOMS AND MOLECULES WITH LASERS, by Vladilen S. Letokhov
	The laser, tuned precisely to the frequency of the radiation emitted or  absorbed by an atom or a molecule, becomes a highly sensitive probe. It  can detect minute amounts of one substance in another (plucking a single  platinum atom out of a trillion molecules of seawater, for example) or  explore the energetic structure of an atomic nucleus.
85 THE INSULIN FACTORY, by Lelio Orci, Jean-Dominique Vassalli and Alain Perrelet
	Insulin is made in the beta cell of the pancreas—but how, and in what  stages? Combining biochemistry with advanced electron micrography, the  authors and others have traced the subcellular assembly line, identifying  successive workstations where a precursor molecule is synthesized and  processed into insulin and the hormone is exported from the cell.
96 A CLOSE LOOK AT HALLEY'S COMET, by Hans Balsiger, Hugo Fechtig and Johannes Geiss
	It has been two and a half years since an armada of spacecraft lifted off for  a close encounter with Halley's comet. Intensive analysis of the data that  were telemetered from European, Japanese and Soviet probes confirms the  "dirty snowball" model of comet structure and provides clues to the nature  of the materials that formed the solar system.
104 THE FOSSILS OF MONTCEAU-LES-MINES, by Daniel Heyler and Cecile M Poplin
	Some 300 million years ago, when the continents were grouped near the  Equator, France's Massif Central was tropical. Streams, lakes and estuaries  teemed with amphibians, fish, arthropods and mollusks, and giant ferns  covered the hills. A remarkable fossil cache has enabled paleontologists to  reconstruct what life there was like in the Upper Carboniferous.
112 PLASMA-SPRAYED COATINGS, by Herbert Herman
	The plasma gun's high-temperature flame can convert almost any  powdered material into a molten spray. Jet-engine components and other  parts that will be subjected to fierce heat, mechanical stress or chemical  attack can now be sheathed in an insulating ceramic almost as easily as a  coat of latex paint can be laid down with a spray gun.
118 THE DISCOVERY OF THE VISUAL CORTEX, by Mitchell Glickstein
	The foundations of today's knowledge of how the brain processes visual  images were laid over a period of more than a century by a series of  investigators, many of them now long forgotten. Ironically, knowledge of  how the world is mapped onto the cortex owes much to the introduction  of a new high-velocity rifle in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5.

	Where do we stand? Wat are the key areas of current research? The prospects for therapy or a vaccine? In their frst collaborative article the two investigators who established the cause of ADS answer these questions and tell how HN was isolated and linked to AIDS.
52 THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE AIDS VIRUS, by William A. Haseltine and Flossie Wong-Staal
	Just three viral genes can direct the machinery of an infected cell to make a new HIV particle-provided that at least three other viral genes give the go-ahead. These regulatory genes give the virus its protean behavioral repertoire: they spur viral replication, hold it in check or bring it to a halt
64 THE ORIGINS OF THE AIDS VIRUS, by ssex and Phyllis J. Kanki
	The AIDS virus has a past and it has relatives. An inquiry into its family  history can reveal how the related viruses interact with human beings and  ys. The inquiry may also uncover vulnerabilities: some forms of the virus have evolved toward disease-free coexistence with their hosts.
72 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AIDS IN THE U.S., by William L. Heyward and James W. Curran
	Since 1981 more than 66,000 people in the U.S. have contracted AIDS; by 1992 there
	may be 300,000 more cases -- even if the incidence of infection begins to decline. 
	By identifying risk groups and risky behaviors, epidemiology can suggest nonmedical
	strategies for controlling AIDS.
82 THE INTERNATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AIDS, by Jonathan M. Mann, James Chin, Peter Piot and Thomas Quinn
	The pandemic is still in its early stages. Although no one is certain how  AIDS cases have already developed, the World Health Organization  estimates the number at 250,000. Furthermore, at least five million people wide are probably infected with the AIDS virus.
90 HIV INFECTION: THE CLINICAL PICTURE, by Robert R. Redfield and Donald S. Burke 
	To focus only on treating ADS is to lose the battle against HIV, the virus that causes it. AIDS is actually the final manifestation of a progressive immune disorder that may be silent for years. Early diagnosis and accurate staging of HIV infection help physicians to optimize therapy.
100 HIV INFECTION: THE CELLULAR PICTURE, by Jonathan N. Weber and Robin A. Weiss
	The AIDS virus can do no damage until it enters a target cell. The first step in invasion is the binding of a molecule on the viral membrane to a molecule on the membrane of the target. The receptor molecule, known as the CD4 antigen, exists primarily on certain immune-system cells.
110 AIDS THERAPIES, by Robert Yarchoan, Hiroaki Mitsuya and Samuel Broder
	The prognosis for treatment was once grim, but now understanding of  HIV's life cycle makes it possible to design drugs that take aim at specific  targets. The authors describe an all-out effort to develop a number of  drugs that can be administered in a concerted attack
120 AIDS VACCINES, by Thomas J. Matthews and Dani P. Bolognesi

128 THE SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF AIDS, by Harvey V. Fineberg
	To cope with an ever increasing number of cases, public-health officials  must focus not only on medical and hospital concerns but also on  prevention, largely through education. AIDS patients require compassionate  and effective care; there should be broad prohibition of discrimination.

54 EDUCATING POOR MINORITY CHILDREN, by James P. Comer
	The inadequate education of black children from urban ghettos condemns  many of them to lives of chronic unemployment and desperation. Is there a  way to bring such children into the mainstream of a technological society?  The author built on his own childhood experiences to develop a' strategy  that is now working in 50 schools around the counfry.
62 QUASI-PERIODIC OSCILLATIONS IN CELESTIAL X-RAY SOURCES, by Michiel van der Klis
	Regular variations in the intensity of X-ray emanations can yield  information about a celestial X-ray source: it may be orbited by an eclipsing  star, for example, or may rotate like a lighthouse beam. What is one to  make of powerful sources near the center of our galaxy whose X-ray  intensity fluctuates not quite periodically but not quite at random?
72 WHAT MAKES A TUMOR CELL METASTATIC?, by Michael Feldman and Lea Eisenbach
	The tumor cells that undergo metastasis, traveling through the  bloodstream to establish new tumors, turn out to bear on their surface a distinctive pattern of molecules that enable them to evade the immune  system. This feature and others that are unique to metastatic cells point  the way toward what may one day be a new kind of cancer therapy.
104 THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THUNDERSTORMS, by Earle R Williams
	An average thunderstorm generates several lightning flashes per minute  and as much electric power as a small nuclear plant. To produce such large  amounts of power a thundercloud must be charged to potentials of several  hundred million volts. Models have been developed that explain aspects of the charging process, but the fundamental physics is still a mystery.
116 SUPERFLUID TURBULENCE, by Russell J. Donnelly
	Liquid helium cooled to within about two degrees of absolute zero can flow  without viscosity or friction, but it is not immune to a form of turbulence  that is quantum-mechanical in nature. For example, the rates at which  superfluid atoms circulate in a vortex are precisely determined by the same equation that fixes the radii of electron orbits in an atom.
126 INFRARED OPTICAL FIBERS, by Martin G. Drexhage and Cornelius T. Moynihan
	Optical fibers made of highly transparent silica glass can carry voice and  data signals for as much as 50 kilometers without reamplification. New  materials that transmit longer wavelengths of light can in theory be 20  times as transparent as silica glass. They may eventually be able to carry  signals for hundreds or perhaps thousands of miles. Evolution of Human Walking C. Owen Lovejoy When did our ancestors begin to walk on two legs, and what anatomical  changes made it possible? Analysis of the pelvis of Lucy, a three-million-  year-old hominid, reveals that upright walking had been perfected by her  time. The author thinks bipedality developed early because it enabled  males to nurture a family: it freed their hands to carry food.

36 MANAGING SOLID WASTE, by Philip R. O'Leary, Patrick W. Walsh and Robert K. Ham
	Every year Americans transform cereal boxes, glassware, refrigerators and food scraps into 140 million metric tons of municipal waste; we have  run out of places to put it. Yet the problem can be solved. Manufacturers  could minimize packaging, trash could be sorted and recycled, and new incinerator and landfill technology could reduce pollution.
46 THE GEOMETRIC PHASE, by Michael Berry
	Sometimes a variable describing a physical system (say an electron circling  in a magnetic field) fails to return to its original value when the system  returns to its original position. The geometric phase elegantly explains, in ways that are useful to physicists and technologists, the behavior  of particles in certain quantum-mechanical situations.
56 PLASTICITY IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, by Chiye Aoki and Philip Siekevitz
	The infant's brain is not a fait accompli. Experience and use refine and  restructure the web of fibers connecting one nerve cell to another. Now a  protein has been discovered that plays a major role in rewiring the visual  system—the first such protein to be identified. The finding could lead to  better understanding of how other brain areas are shaped by experience.
68 PATTERNED GROUND, by William B. Krantz, Kevin J. Gleason and Nelson Caine 
	Cycles of freezing and thawing can shape rocks, soil and vegetation into  varied and striking geometric figures. The authors have developed models  that show how convection could account for some of the patterns.
78 FERTILIZATION IN MAMMALS, by Paul M Wassarman
	Multitudes of sperm bind to an ovum and penetrate its outer coat, but  only one manages to fertilize the egg. A single molecule called the sperm  receptor, a glycoprotein, governs many of the events of fertilization,  including the processes by which the fertilized egg is rendered immune  to the blandishments of late arrivals.
86 SOFT-X-RAY LASERS, by Dennis L. Matthews and Mordecai D. Rosen
	Now laser light is not just red or green. It can be a coherent, collimated  beam of X-ray photons, at wavelengths 100 times shorter than those of the optical spectrum. A soft-X-ray laser should be able to form three-  dimensional images—holograms—of living biological structures, such as chromosomes, that are too small to be imaged by the light microscope.
92 SNAKES, BLOOD CIRCULATION AND GRAVITY, by Harvey B. Lillywhite
	What keeps a snake from fainting when it rears up to strike or crawls up  the trunk of a tree? Why does the blood not drain away from the head and  pool in the tail? It turns out that the cardiovascular systems of terrestrial  snakes—arboreal ones in particular—are remarkably well adapted to  maintaining circulation against the force of gravity.
100 CANAL BUILDERS OF PRE-INCA PERU, by Charles R. Ortloff
	The economy of the Chimu, who inhabited the northern coast of what  is now Peru 1,000 years ago, was based on agriculture, but the arid climate demanded irrigation. Chimu engineers designed and constructed  a remarkable system of terraced canals that brought water from sources as far as 70 kilometers away across the foothills of the Andes.

34 ON SCIENCE ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT, by Jerome B. Wiesner
	What worked for presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy will work for  President-elect Bush. The author advocates reviving the President's  Science Advisory Committee (which he headed under Kennedy) to give  the new president the scientific community's best thinking on issues  such as industrial policy, defense and the environment.
40 HOW GENE ACTIVATORS WORK, by Mark Ptashne
	A cell does not need all its genes all the time; it switches them on and off.  Regulatory proteins bind to specific regions of DNA and start or stop the production of protein from nearby or distant genes. By studying gene  regulation in viruses and yeast, the author and his colleagues have  uncovered principles that also apply in more advanced organisms.
48 DEEP EARTHQUAKES, by Cliff Frohlich
	Earthquakes are often recorded at depths as great as 650 kilometers or  more. These deep events mark regions where plates of the earth's surface  are consumed in the mantle. But the earthquakes themselves present a co-  nundrum: the high pressures at such depths should keep rock from frac-  turing suddenly and generating a tremor. What gives in deep earthquakes?
56 THE MIXING OF FLUIDS, by Julio M. Ottino
	Marbled endpapers, the eruption of a volcano and the making of puff  pastry are all instances of mixing by stretching and folding. Laboratory  mixing experiments offer insights into the stunning complexities of  everyday mixing and serve as models of chaotic behavior: the time-varying  flows wreak disorder that nonetheless has a certain symmetry.
68 CARBOHYDRATES AND DEPRESSION, by Richard J. Wurtman and Judith J. Wurtman
	As the year wears on and the nights lengthen, many people become  listless and depressed; they seek consolation in carbohydrate-rich snacks.  Bright light can help, as can drugs that enhance the action of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. SAD (seasonal affective disorder) has some features  in common with premenstrual syndrome and a form of obesity.
76 THE HUNT FOR PROCONSUL, by Alan Walker and Mark Teaford
	Crushed, confused with pig bones and scattered among collections around  the world, the remains of an apelike creature that lived in East Africa some 18 million years ago have now been reassembled. The slow-moving,  tree-living hominoid that has taken shape probably represents the last  common ancestor of human beings and the great apes.
84 THE SHORTEST-NETWORK PROBLEM, by Marshall W. Bern and Ronald L. Graham
	The problem is easy to state: Draw the shortest possible network of line  segments interconnecting, say, 100 points. It is also unsolvable, in many  cases. But its sheer fascination together with its practical importance to  designers of telephone networks, for example, have led to the development  of algorithms that yield rough solutions quickly.
90 ANDRE-MARIE AMPERE, by L. Pearce Williams
	In the early 19th century Ampere made pioneering contributions to the  philosophy of science and the study of electricity and magnetism. His conviction that theoretical entities—themselves unobservable—  could nonetheless be studied through their interactions guided his  investigation of the magnetic effects of electric currents.

32 SOVIETS IN SPACE, by Peter M. Banks and Sally K. Ride
	The Soviet Union has maintained an almost continuous human presence in  space since 1977 with a space-station program that absorbs only 15  percent of its launch capability and does not strain ground facilities. The  introduction of a space shuttle and a powerful new rocket suggests that  the Soviets may be planning an even more ambitious agenda.
42 THE GENES FOR COLOR VISION, by Jeremy Nathans
	Three centuries of experimentation in optics, psychophysics and  biochemistry established the dependence of color vision on three kinds  of light-absorbing molecules, or pigments, in the cone cells of the retina.  The author has isolated the genes that encode the pigments and has  identified genetic anomalies that lead to color blindness.
50 GIANT OCEAN CATARACTS, by John A. Whitehead
	The largest cascades of water on the earth are not famous waterfalls but  unseen density currents deep in the ocean. Driven by differences in  temperature or salinity, these cataracts carry as much as five million cubic  meters of water per second and can plunge more than three kilometers.  They have a vital role in determining the climate of the world's oceans.
60 THE NEW SUPERCONDUCTORS: PROSPECTS FOR APPLICATIONS, by Alan M. Wolsky, Robert F. Giese and Edward J. Daniels
	It could take at least a decade to develop high-temperature superconductors suited to practical applications. Economic considerations suggest that the new materials will have their biggest impact not on large-scale applications in the electric-power industry or transportation but on smaller devces for manufacturing, electronics and medicine.
74 FROM BIRD SONG TO NEUROGENESIS, by Fernando Nottebohm
	One of the dogmas of neurobiology has it that when nerve cells in the  vertebrate brain die, they are not replaced by new ones. The author finds to  the contrary. He has shown that when the adult canary needs to learn new  songs, it does grow some new neurons. The finding could eventually lead  to the discovery of ways to repair lesions in the human brain.
80 THE CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ULTRASOUND, by Kenneth S. Suslick
	The exposure of a liquid to intense sound waves induces cavitation:  microscopic bubbles form and implode suddenly and violently, so that  their contents are first heated to the temperature of the sun's surface and  then cooled within microseconds. Ultrasound presents chemists with a new  source of energy to drive chemical reactions that create novel compounds.
88 TEETH AND PREHISTORY IN ASIA, by Christy G. Turner II
	Where did the peoples of East Asia, Polynesia and the Americas originate?  Teeth tell the story. Analysis of minute dental features shows that two  great population groups formed in southeast Asia beginning more than  20,000 years ago. The movement of one group can be traced across the  Bering land bridge into North America and all the way to Chile.
98 THE HISTORY OF CENSUS TABULATION, by Keith S. Reid-Green
	Late in the 19th century it became clear that the tangle of data collected  from a growing population could no longer be tabulated by busy people  wielding pencils. Enter a forerunner of the computer era: Herman  Hollerith's punched-card system. The necessities of the census mothered  many more inventions, culminating in the digital computer.

38 U.S. ACCESS TO SPACE, by John M. Logsdon and Ray A. Williamson
	In spite of Discovery's successful launching last fall, the U.S. space program  is troubled. Scientific, military and commercial space missions are almost  three years behind schedule; other countries have stepped in to meet the  demand for launch capability. The space program needs a diverse array of  unmanned launch vehicles—and a set of clear, productive goals.
48 MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE IN CANCER, by Norbert Kartner and Victor Ling
	Chemotherapy often fails because a tumor develops resistance to an array  of different drugs. A single glycoprotein turns out to be responsible: it  proliferates in some cells and pumps out the drugs. Now that the protein  pump has been identified it may be possible to interfere with its action or  to make it the target for drugs that destroy the cancer cell.
58 PLASMA PARTICLE ACCELERATORS, by John M. Dawson
	A new technology for exploring the fundamental nature of matter stands in  the wings, able in theory to accelerate particles to energies higher than  those to be attained by the Superconducting Supercollider. Particles gain  energy in the plasma accelerator by riding electromagnetic waves through  a tube filled with a gas of dissociated positive ions and electrons.
74 MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALS, by Alexander McPherson 
	X-ray crystallography is a powerful technique for revealing the structure  of large molecules. The first requirement—and a difficult one—is to make  nearly flawless crystals of the protein or nucleic acid under study.
86 MODELING THE GEOCHEMICAL CARBON CYCLE, by Robert A. Berner and Antonio C. Lasaga
	The authors have modeled the slow, long-term cycle in which geochemical  processes transfer carbon among land, sea and atmosphere; their model  suggests that the earth may have been warmed in the past when buildups  of atmospheric carbon dioxide enhanced the greenhouse effect. Now  human beings are short-circuiting the long-term cycle.
94 THE BIOLOGY OF OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS, by Judith L. Rapoport
	Samuel Johnson kept darting through doorways; a teen-ager named Sergei  is unable to stop washing. Such repetitive, ritualistic behavior can make a person unable to function. The author thinks obsessive-compulsive  disorder has biological roots in specific brain structures; she has treated  it with certain drugs initially developed as antidepressants.
102 LESSONS OF SUNRAYCER, by Howard G. Wilson, Paul B. MacCready and Chester R. Kyle
	Powered entirely by sunlight, the 400-pound automobile averaged 41 miles  per hour to win a 1,867-mile race across Australia on the solar equivalent  of five gallons of gas. The integrated design and novel technology that  helped Sunraycer to win could find application in practical electric cars.  Indeed, prototype electric vans will soon be in production.
110 THE ROMAN AQUEDUCT OF NIMES, by George F. W. Hauck
	The high-arching Pont du Gard in southern France is a link in a remarkable  aqueduct built some 2,000 years ago to bring water to a Latin colony. It has  been thought that Roman engineers built by guess and by gosh, but the  author's calculations show they knew just what they were doing: the  aqueduct meets modern standards for strength and hydraulic efficiency.

48 GLOBAL CLIMATIC CHANGE, by Richard A. Houghton and George M. Woodwell
	Citing historical data on temperature and on atmospheric levels of carbon  dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the authors maintain that the world  is already in the grip of a warming trend. Unless stringent measures are  taken, they contend, rising temperatures will increase sea levels and shift  climate zones, causing profound economic and social distress.
60 THE TURNOVER OF MESSENGER RNA, by Jeffrey Ross
	The structure and function of every cell are established by the proteins  it synthesizes, and hence by the amount of messenger RNA specifying  each protein. The amount of mRNA depends in turn not only on how  much mRNA is transcribed from a given gene but also on the rate of  turnover, or degradation, of the mRNA. What factors control that rate?
68 QUANTUM INTERFERENCE AND THE AHARONOV-BOHM EFFECT, by Yoseph Imry and Richard A. Webb
	Can electrons be influenced by a nearby magnet so well shielded that its force field cannot be detected? The counterintuitive answer is yes: an  energy emanation from the magnet known as the potential does indeed  affect the electrons' wave function. This quantum-mechanical effect is  being brought to bear on the development of new microelectronic devices.
78 ASTROCYTES, by Harold K. Kimelberg and Michael D. Norenberg
	They are brain cells but not neurons. For a long time all that was  known about them was that they are star-shaped, beautiful and—unlike neurons—not excitable; they seemed to have a passive supporting role in  the brain. Recent work suggests, on the contrary, that they have specific  active roles in brain function and development and in causing disease.
96 FREE-ELECTRON LASERS, by Henry P. Freund and Robert K. Parker
	FELS can be tuned to any frequency and in theory can be highly efficient.  Their potential applications range from research in physics and chemistry  through medicine to industrial uses and perhaps strategic defense. Some  major new developments in electron accelerators and in "wigglers" suggest  that FELS may soon be able to redeem this broad array of promises.
102 SENSORY FUNCTION IN THE HARBOR SEAL, by Deane Renouf
	Like other amphibians, the harbor seal needs to cope with life both in the  water and on land. Sensory adaptations that make for success when Phoca  vitulina is submerged may not be effective, and indeed may even be coun-  terproductive, when the animal hauls out on the shore. How does the seal  manage to navigate and hunt in the water and nurse its young on land?
108 THE TRIREME SAILS AGAIN, by John F. Coates
	The fabled oared warship of classical Greece played an important role in the rise and defense of Hellenic civilization. In the absence of material  evidence scholars have long argued about the ship's design, construction  and performance. The author and his colleagues have settled some of  those questions by reconstructing a trireme and testing it under oar.
118 CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN ISLAND, by Emmy E. Werner
	For most children the combination of reproductive stress and a childhood  burdened by poverty, family discord and inadequate nurturing spells a  bleak future. Yet some manage to thrive. What explains their resilience?  The author has found some answers by following, from birth to the age of  18, the cohort of children born in 1955 on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.

54 TECHNOLOGY, EMPLOYMENT AND U.S. COMPETITIVENESS, by Richard M. Cyert and David C. Mowery
	How does investment in new technology affect employment? Luddite fears  to the contrary, technology need not abolish jobs; indeed, it tends to create  them. The technological fast track does, however, call for a work force that  is well educated and thus adaptable to change, and so the sorry state of U.S. education may threaten the future of the U.S. economy.
66 CREATING SUPERHEAVY ELEMENTS, by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Miinzenberg
	Physicists continue to create massive, unstable transuranic elements in the  laboratory. Strangely, the heavier they are the longer they last, stabilized by  subtle quantum-mechanical effects. And whereas the trick used to be to  slam light elements into heavy ones at high energies, what works now is  colliding two medium-weight elements at modest energies.
76 TOPOBIOLOGY, by Gerald M. Edelman
	The term describes interactions among cells that depend on the cells'  position. Cell-surface molecules that mediate the topobiological events of  embryonic development turn out to be related to molecules that mediate  the immune response in vertebrates. It appears that the immunoglobulins  are descended from primitive developmental molecules.
90 THE DYNAMIC AURORA, by Syun-Ichi Akasofu
	The shimmering sheets of light that drape the polar skies are generated by  an interplay of the solar wind's electrons, its magnetic field, the earth's  magnetosphere and particles in the atmosphere. As more is learned about  this planetary generator, it is becoming possible to learn how solar activity  triggers auroral storms, disrupting radio communications.
102 THE PAST AND FUTURE AMAZON, by Paul A. Colinvaux
	The Amazon basin's rain forest supports more species than any other  region on the earth. Now it appears that the diversification has been  favored by frequent perturbation of the region's climate and physical  structure. Such robust response to change bodes well for the Amazon's  resistance to exploitation—if human incursions can be kept within bounds.
110 MARSUPIAL FROGS, by Eugenia M. del Pino
	These frogs, many of them creatures of the tropical-forest canopy, have  broken a crucial tie to the water: instead of depositing her eggs in pools  or streams, the mother incubates them in a special pouch on her back  The long incubation within the mother's body resembles pregnancy in  mammals, but the eggs and embryos of these frogs are birdlike.
120 OPTICAL FIBERS IN MEDICINE, by Abraham Katzir
	With a minimum of trauma, flexible, maneuverable bundles of fibers can  retrieve images from deep recesses in the circulatory system, the lungs and  many other organs. Improved optical-fiber instruments soon may carry  light into the body for therapy: high-power laser beams to cut, cauterize  and ablate tissue, including atherosclerotic plaque and cancers.
126 HENRY NORRIS RUSSELL, by David H. DeVorkin
	Russell bestrode U.S. astronomy between the two world wars and led  the way to astrophysics. By exploiting the findings of atomic physics, he showed how to determine a star's composition and temperature from its  spectrum. In doing so he hastened astronomy's shift from mapping the  heavens to describing stellar mechanisms in the light of the new physics.

39 TOWARD A NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, by Suzanne Berger, Michael L. Dertouzos, Richard K. Lester, Robert M. Solow 
	and Lester C. Thurow What ever happened to "Made in America"? The M.I.T. Commission on  Industrial Productivity examined the performance of U.S. manufacturers.  It found that not all of the blame lies in economic trends or in Japan or  Washington; industry deserves its share. Yet certain firms innovate and  make good products and good profits. What lessons can they teach?
50 HIDDEN EARTHQUAKES, by Ross S. Stein and Robert S. Yeats
	Seismologists generally look for earthquakes to happen along visible fault  lines—the San Andreas, say. The authors maintain that another source of  dangerous quakes has been overlooked: the release of stress along a fault  that is hidden, buried deep under a fold in the earth's crust. The recent  Armenian earthquake seems to have been just such an event.
62 A DIFFERENT KIND OF INHERITANCE, by Robin Holliday
	It is not genetic but epigenetic, dealing not with genes but with the  activity of genes. It controls patterns of gene activity and their faithful  transmission from one cell generation to another and thereby helps to  execute the developmental program. The attachment of methyl groups  (CH3) to DNA may be a major mechanism of epigenetic inheritance.
76 THE FOSSILS OF MONTE SAN GIORGIO, by Toni Burgin, Olivier Rieppel, P. Martin Sander and Karl Tschanz
	Once there was a small sea where a rich assembly of vertabrates lived and died. Their fossils, uplifted on the flank of a mountain near Lake Lugano, are informative snapshots in stone of a Triassic-period fauna.
90 THE FOURIER TRANSFORM, by Ronald N. Bracewell
	The ear calculates transforms automatically. So, with more difficulty, do  scientists, because modern versions of Baron Fourier's 1807 technique can derive meaning from complicated flows of information. They do so by representing an electrical signal, the sound of a violin, heat conduction and other such phenomena as an assemblage of sinusoidal waves.
100 THE CHANNELING OF ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS, by Allan H. SOrensen and Erik Uggerh0j
	When a focused beam of charged particles strikes a crystal at just the  right angle, the particles are channeled by the lattice much as a rolling  ball is constrained by a gutter. Studies of channeling can yield information  about crystal structure and nuclear reactions; one day channeling may  provide improved sources of X rays and gamma rays.
108 AUTHENTICATING ANCIENT MARBLE SCULPTURE, by Stanley V. Margolis
	Was the enigmatically smiling marble youth an ancient Greek masterpiece  or a brilliantly executed fraud? Curators at the Getty Museum were hoping  to answer that question when they called on the author—no art historian  but a marine geochemist—for help. He solved the riddle by applying the  same battery of techniques developed to date sea-bottom sediment cores.
116 ABSINTHE, by Wilfred Niels Arnold
	"Absinthe," the English poet Dowson punned, "makes the tart grow fonder."  Thujone, the toxic active ingredient of the bitter, pale-green liqueur, also  inspired Impressionist painters and Symbolist poets in 19th-century France  and other European countries. Eventually the dangers of absinthe were  recognized, and the drink was outlawed. Today we make do with Pernod.

33 TESTING WEAPONS IN SPACE, by Ashton B. Carter
	The Antiballistic-Missile Treaty seems to forbid the testing of ABM  weapons in space, but the U.S. has pushed for a "broad" interpretation of  the language. Would a more permissive regime really serve U.S. interests?  The testing issue is now on the table again at the START talks, and an  analysis reveals some surprising pitfalls in a permissive construction.
42 MEMORY STORAGE AND NEURAL SYSTEMS, by Daniel L. Alkon
	How does the brain record a memory? An answer to this profound  question begins to take shape. When a snail or a rabbit learns something,  the animal stores the memory in the form of an alteration of the  excitability of particular nerve-cell branches. The change is mediated by the migration to the cell membrane of a key enzyme, protein kinase C.
52 SPIN GLASSES, by Daniel L. Stein
	Once simplification was an effective strategy for discovering the principles  that underlie the complex disorder of nature. Today, the author argues,  simplification yields diminishing returns. He and his colleagues meet the challenge of complexity head-on by studying the discordant  magnetic interactions in a complex system: a spin glass.
62 VOLCANISM AT RIFTS, by Robert S. White and Dan P. McKenzie
	The earth's outer shell rifts continuously: it stretches and splits, both on  the ocean floor and on continents. Every 30 million years or so the rifting  becomes cataclysmic, releasing continent-size floods of magma. The  authors show the same process is at work in both cases; a small increase  in the underlying mantle's temperature makes the routine extraordinary.
78 THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT IN GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION, by Kerstin Uvneis-Moberg
	The gut is the largest endocrine gland in the body. The hormones it  secretes help to orchestrate the changes in metabolism that accompany  pregnancy, fetal and infant growth, and lactation. The author's data  explain many of the symptoms of pregnancy—and they also indicate  that giving a baby a pacifier is physiologically sound.
84 SPACE COLORISTICS, by Vladimir V. Vasyutin and Artur A. Tishchenko
	What does the earth look like in truly living color—that is, to a human  being in space? If orbiting scientists are to serve as accurate remote-  sensing devices, they cannot merely report that the ocean "is the color of  a samovar." An experienced Soviet cosmonaut and a space scientist report  on their efforts to understand and codify the look of the earth from space.
92 VISUAL THINKING IN THE ICE AGE, by Randall White
	The archaeological record reveals that suddenly, 35,000 years ago, there  was an explosion of visual imagery—representations of human beings and  animals in stone, bone and ivory. How did human capacities, society and  the environment combine to produce this flowering of visual imagination?  What does it reveal about our ancestors, about ourselves?
100 SYNTHETIC ZEOLITES, by George T. Kerr
	Heat a natural zeolite, and it bubbles (hence the name, which means  "boiling stone"); it does so because submicroscopic channels that adsorb  water vein its crystalline structure. Synthetic zeolites that mimic the  porous nature of the natural materials are responsible for, among other  things, the catalytic cracking of petroleum to make gasoline.

28 ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMALS IN TOXICITY TESTING, by Alan M. Goldberg and John M. Frazier
	Animal tests of chemical hazards cost from $500,000 to $1.5 million; they  provoke the indignation of animal-welfare activists; their results cannot  always be extrapolated precisely to human beings. In vitro testing, in which  human cells, animal tissues or microbes serve as targets for toxins, is on  the way to offering some economical and practical alternatives.
36 THE GREAT SUPERNOVA OF 1987, by Stan Woosley and Tom Weaver
	When supernova 1987A burst into life in a nearby galaxy, astronomers  found themselves in a ringside seat from which they could watch theory  play out against the unfolding reality of an exploding star. The resulting  observations have confirmed major aspects of the current understanding  of supernovas but have also posed some fresh challenges.
46 VIRAL ALTERATION OF CELL FUNCTION, by Michael B. A. Oldstone
	Fever, inflammation and cell destruction usually accompany viral infection.  But some viruses slip into a cell's genome without eliciting an effective  immune response and reside there indefinitely rather than killing the cell.  Subtle disturbances may follow. Certain endocrine and autoimmune  diseases may be among the effects of such persistent infections.
54 THE MATING OF TREE CRICKETS, by David H. Funk 
	The male tree cricket has evolved an intricate set of postmating maneuvers  to prevent the female from eating the sperm-containing sac that he  transfers to her—until insemination is completed.
70 THE METAMORPHOSIS OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, by David Gelemter
	If the great French engineer Eiffel were alive today, he would be working in  software, not steel. Parallel programs for information management can be  used to create electronic machines that provide extraordinary mastery,  marshalling vast quantities of information to shape answers for managers,  administrators, scientists, physicians and other professionals.
78 THE MIDDLE-EAR MUSCLES, by Erik Borg and S. Allen Counter
	The four smallest muscles in the human body have one of the most  significant functions: lodged in pairs in the middle ear, they control the  amount of acoustical energy that reaches the auditory receptor cells. They  thus guard against loud sounds (including one's own voice) and, by making  it easier to detect soft high-frequency sounds, improve our hearing.
86 MAYA WRITING, by David Stuart and Stephen D. Houston
	Of all the peoples of pre-Columbian America, the Maya had the most  developed system of writing. Yet this window on their culture has been  virtually opaque: the writing could not be deciphered. In recent decades a  few determined scholars have learned to read Maya inscriptions and thus  have brought the Maya from prehistory into history.
94 THE AGE-OF-THE-EARTH DEBATE, by Lawrence Badash
	Although the age of the earth seems a comfortably settled fact, 150 years  ago it was hotly contested. Darwin, Kelvin, Rutherford and Rayleigh were  among the great figures who grappled with the problem and with one  another. The discovery of radioactivity, and of how to interpret the  evidence it deposits in rocks, has resolved the matter—for now.

48 MANAGING PLANET EARTH, by William C Clark
	In the millennia since our species emerged, it has colonized the planet  exuberantly. Can we summon the intelligence to understand the biological  and physical system of which we are a part, so that we can pursue  economic growth and development in ecologically sustainable ways?
60 THE CHANGING ATMOSPHERE, by Thomas E. Graedel and Paul J. Crutzen
	The chemistry of the atmosphere is changing, in large measure because  of gases emitted by such human activities as farming, manufacturing and  the combustion of fossil fuels. The deleterious effects are increasingly  evident; they may well become worse in the years ahead.
76 THE CHANGING CLIMATE, by Stephen H. Schneider
	The earth owes its hospitable climate to the greenhouse effect, but now  the effect threatens to intensify, rapidly warming the planet. Rising  concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases are the cause. The  danger of warming is serious enough to warrant prompt action.
86 THREATS TO THE WORLD'S WATER, by J. W. Maurits la Riviere
	Water, most precious of all resources, is in short supply in many regions;  almost everywhere increasing amounts of organic waste and industrial  pollutants threaten its quality. Only international cooperation in the  integrated management of water resources can ameliorate the situation.
114 THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY, by Edward 0. Wilson
	The elimination of habitats—and in particular the felling of species-rich  tropical rain forests—is driving plant and animal species to extinction  in unprecedented numbers. The accelerating loss of diversity is nothing  less than a moral, scientific and economic tragedy.
124 THE GROWING HUMAN POPULATION, by Nathan Key fitz
	Populations will stabilize as development brings economic and social  advances. Yet even as rates of increase decline, absolute numbers soar.  How can poor nations progress when population growth not only hastens  degradation of the environment but also threatens development itself?
132 STRATEGIES FOR AGRICULTURE, by Pierre R. Crosson and Norman J. Rosenberg
	Agricultural science and technology may indeed find ways to feed 10  billion people 100 years from now, but social and economic changes will  have to be made to persuade individual farmers to adopt methods that  will boost food production without further degrading the environment.
146 STRATEGIES FOR ENERGY USE, by John H. Gibbons, Peter D. Blair and Holly L. Gwin
	Nuclear power, solar cells, wind and tide will all have roles in supplying  energy for growth and development without aggravating the greenhouse  effect. Yet exotic new energy sources alone cannot meet the challenge.  Significarjt improvement in the efficiency of energy use is the real hope.
164 STRATEGIES FOR MANUFACTURING, by Robert A. Frosch and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos
	Can the industrial way of life be maintained without exhausting resources,  generating unmanageable amounts of waste and poisoning the  environment? Creative engineering can provide an "industrial ecosystem,"  characterized by dematerialization and closed-system manufacturing.
154 STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, by Jim MacNeill
	Economic growth in developing countries must accelerate to meet the  needs of larger populations. Growth can be attained by means that do not  damage the environment, and governments—north and south—will have to  muster the determination to follow these alternative paths to development.
176 TOWARD A SUSTAINABLE WORLD, by William D. Ruckelshaus
	Moving people and nations toward sustainability requires changes in values  and social institutions on a scale comparable to two other transforming  events in the history of humankind: the agricultural revolution and the  Industrial Revolution. Some initial strategies are proposed.

41 THE QUIET PATH TO TECHNOLOGICAL PREEMINENCE, by Robert B. Reich
	The U.S. government has responded to a series of competitive setbacks in  the global marketplace by announcing ambitious "initiatives" to force the  bloom on the technological rose. The author thinks this loudly proclaimed  path is the wrong one: what is needed is a new set of policies designed to  move technology and design from the lab to the factory floor.
48 THE MITOTIC SPINDLE, by J. Richard McIntosh and Kent L. McDonald
	A cell cannot divide successfully without the mitotic spindle, the bundle  of minute fibers that ensures the separation of the cell's chromosomes  into two equal groups. Recent investigations have uncovered many elusive  details of structure and behavior and have shown the spindle to be an extraordinarily dynamic and fine-tuned biological machine.
58 THE STANFORD LINEAR COLLIDER, by John R. Rees
	The great two-mile-long linear accelerator at Stanford has returned from  the brink of obsolescence. Reincarnated as the Stanford Linear Collider, it  enables physicists to accelerate high-energy electrons and positrons and  then slam them into each other. The result? A tool that promises new  discoveries about a fundamental force of nature.
74 THE CYCLING OF CALCIUM AS AN INTRACELLULAR MESSENGER, by Howard Rasmussen
	A major structural component of teeth, bone and shell, calcium is also  an essential messenger at the cellular level. It mediates such sustained  responses as smooth muscle contraction and hormone secretion not by  becoming concentrated in the interior of the cell, as has been thought,  but by cycling back and forth across the cell's outer membrane.
90 CARBON MONOXIDE AND THE BURNING EARTH, by Reginald E. Newell, Henry G. Reichle, Jr, and Wolfgang Seiler
	Carbon monoxide (not to be confused with carbon dioxide) is one of many  gases whose presence in the atmosphere is blamed largely on industrial  activity in the Northern Hemisphere. Data collected by the authors now  show that the gas is also abundant in the Southern Hemisphere, where it comes mainly from the burning of tropical rain forests and savannas.
98 WATERWEED INVASIONS, by Spencer C. H. Barrett
	Although they are beautiful to look at, two aquatic plants—the water  hyacinth and the kariba weed—wreak ecological and economic havoc in  many regions of the world. In the absence of natural predators the plants  grow uncontrollably, forming vast mats that clog waterways and kill fish.  Imaginative programs now offer hope for their control.
106 SCANNED-PROBE MICROSCOPES, by H. Kumar Wickramasinghe
	Microscopes of a new generation dispense with lenses and rely instead on  fantastically sharp probes to "feel" the contours of surfaces, atom by atom.  Such microscopes can map atomic-scale properties as well as topography.  They are becoming both a standard tool of fundamental science and an  instrument for quality control in the microelectronics industry.
114 THE ORIGINS OF INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGES, by Colin Renfrew
	Most European languages descend from a single ancestral tongue. From  where did it come? One theory implicates a band of warrior nomads who  swept across the continent in late prehistoric times. It is more likely, the  author says, that practitioners of agriculture brought the progenitor  language to Europe with them as they moved west seeking land.

36 THE YELLOWSTONE FIRES, by William H. Romme and Don G. Despain
	During the summer of 1988 flames swept across much of Yellowstone  National Park. More acres burned that year-720,000 to be exact—than had  burned in any decade since 1872. Could the fires have been prevented?  Should they have been? No to both questions. Large fires, it seems, are not  only inevitable; they are also necessary mediators of ecological change.
48 DOUBLE-BETA DECAY, by Michael K. Moe and Simon Peter Rosen
	Experiments confirm what has been predicted by theory: that two neutrons  will decay simultaneously into two protons, two electrons and two  neutrinos. Physicists hope that by studying the rare phenomenon—known  as double-beta decay—they may discover whether or not the neutrino has  mass; if it does, the implications for cosmic evolution could be profound.
58 HOW T CELLS SEE ANTIGEN, by Howard M. Grey, Alessandro Sette and Sfiren Buus
	These small white blood cells marshall the body's immune response and  destroy infected cells. Yet by themselves they are blind to signs of invasion.  Other cells, it turns out, must break down foreign material and "present" it to the T cells. Understanding this intricate process may lead to new  vaccines and treatments for immune disorders.
70 THE MAMMALIAN CHOROID PLEXUS, by Reynold Spector and Conrad E. Johanson
	By selectively regulating what passes out of the bloodstream and into the  cerebrospinal fluid, the choroid plexus acts as a gatekeeper to the brain.  New findings underscore the importance of this small cluster of cells. They  also open up possibilities for a new generation of drugs that can cross the  blood-brain barrier and attack pathogens in the brain.
86 NEPTUNE, by June Kinoshita 
	Twelve years after being launched, the intrepid spacecraft Voyager 2 has  reached Neptune, the final destination of its planetary odyssey. The reward  is a stunning portfolio of images showing a surprisingly dynamic planet.
96 SHUTTLE GLOW, by Donald E. Hunton
	During flight a strange orange glow emanates from the tail and engine  pods of the U.S. space shuttle. The glow itself may be benign but is asso-  ciated with something more sinister. Atmospheric gases, it seems, react  chemically with the shuttle's outer skin, causing it to erode. If unchecked,  surface erosion can threaten the structural integrity of a spacecraft.
104 THE WORLD'S OLDEST ROAD, by John M. Coles
	For 6,000 years, a wood walkway lay buried in a peat bog in southwestern  England, protected and preserved by the acid and water of the bog. The  excavated wood, together with artifacts and plant remains recovered from  the surrounding peat, yields a remarkably detailed picture of life in an  early Neolithic community.
112 THE CASE FOR METHANOL, by Charles L. Gray, Jr., and Jeffrey A. Alson
	Spurred by concerns of declining air quality, the race for alternative auto-  motive fuels is on. The authors advocate a switch to methanol, arguing that  it is the most economic and environmentally prudent of the fuels now be-  ing considered. How should the U.S. respond? By developing a methanol-  based transportation system—the authors say—as soon as possible.

67 GETTING OUT OF THE STARTING BLOCK, by Sidney N. Graybeal and Patricia Bliss McFate
	Worries about verification should not be putting the brakes on START. The  best way to reach a beneficial agreement is to pursue negotiations on arms  reduction and on verification together. The key, the authors say, is to try to match the arms-reduction requirements of a treaty with the ability to  detect and deter militarily significant violations.
74 THE EVOLUTION OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD, by Jeremy Bloxham and David Gubbins
	The origin of the field has fascinated more than a dozen generations  of physicists. Molten iron in the outer core, driven by convection and  influenced by the earth's rotation, acts as a dynamo that generates the field. Now historical records of magnetic-field changes yield new insights  into the process and into how the field may behave in the future.
82 SYNAPSE FORMATION IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN, by Ronald E. Kalil
	How is the brain wired? How do some 100 billion nerve cells in the  developing brain come to be linked correctly to one another? Like muscles,  it turns out, the nerve cells need exercise. More specifically, formation of the proper synaptic connections between neurons depends in part  on the electrical activity of the developing neurons themselves.
94 THE FIRST COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS, by The First Color Photographs
	Grant B. Romer and Jeannette Delamoir Attempts to make color images are as old as photography itself. Ingenious  schemes devised in the 19th century laid the basis for most of today's  processes and left behind an engaging record of bygone times and places.
116 MICROCLUSTERS, by Michael A. Duncan and Dennis H. Rouvray
	Divide a piece of metal again and again and eventually you arrive at a new  state of matter: a microcluster of from two to 100 or so atoms. Somewhere  en route, the sample will have started to behave in new ways, exhibiting  novel chemical, electrical and optical properties that could have  applications in catalysis and other industrial processes.
122 THE BIRDS OF PARADISE, by Bruce M. Beehler
	Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were fascinated by them;  evolutionary biologists and students of animal behavior still prowl the  New Guinea rain forests to observe them. In the Paradisaeidae, foraging  ecology has been shown to orchestrate complex interrelations among  plumage, reproductive behavior and social organization.
132 TELEOPERATORS, by William R. Uttal
	Someday, when artificial intelligence or another form of computer smarts  comes into its own, autonomous robots may replace human beings in toxic,  radioactive or otherwise hostile environments. Until then, new teleoperator  technology can combine human intelligence and manipulative ability in real  time with the long arm of mechanical linkages and advanced electronics.
138 THE MITHRAIC MYSTERIES, by David Ulansey
	For almost a century students of this ancient Mediterranean cult have  sought an allegorical interpretation of the significance of the religion's  central icon: the image of a young man killing a bull. The author and other  scholars have begun to solve the mystery by refastening that image, the  "tauroctony," to its astronomical and theological moorings.
